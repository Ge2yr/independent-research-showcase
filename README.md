# Independent Research Showcase

Welcome to my research showcase. This repository serves as the landing page for my independent research projects that bridge psychological science, machine learning, and systems theory. It links to public projects and provides a high‑level overview of my work.

## Projects

- **romr‑methodology** — experimental scaffolding and methods for stress‑testing learning systems. See the [romr‑methodology](../romr-methodology) repository for protocols, logging schemas, and reproducible workflows.
- **romr‑benchmarks** — public benchmarks demonstrating reproducibility and experiment design. See the [romr‑benchmarks](../romr-benchmarks) repository for scripts and results on CIFAR, Tiny ImageNet, and MNIST.

## About Me

I am an independent researcher with a background in psychological science and machine learning. My work focuses on designing experiments rather than coding large libraries; I build hypotheses, refine protocols, identify confounds, and conduct diverse stress tests to surface common phenomena.

For my résumé and contact details, please see the `resume` file in this repository or visit my LinkedIn profile.
