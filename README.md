# Independent Research Skills Showcase

This repository highlights the practical skills Iâ€™ve developed through independent research and experimentation. While my proprietary research (ROMâ€‘R framework) is under NDA/patent, the examples here demonstrate applied skills across machine learning, simulation, automation, and visualization that are safe to share publicly.

## ðŸ”‘ Skills Demonstrated

- **Machine Learning Engineering**: PyTorch training loops, earlyâ€‘warning stability monitors, benchmark evaluations (CIFAR/MNIST).
- **Computational Experimentation**: Stress test frameworks, CSV logging, plotting, reproducible workflows.
- **Simulation & Modeling**: Recursive toy systems, chaos/oscillation analysis, emergent behaviour demos.
- **Visualization**: Python + Blender scripting, Matplotlib plots.
- **Automation**: Anaconda + WSL environment setup, PowerShell utilities.
- **Technical Communication**: Clear documentation, reproducible experiments, interdisciplinary presentation.

## ðŸ“Š Repository Structure

```
ml_benchmarks/     # CIFAR/MNIST training + stability monitors
residual_monitors/ # Generic residual + gradient norm checks
simulations/       # Toy recursive loops, chaos maps
visualization/     # Blender + Matplotlib scripts

Each folder contains small, safe-to-share examples that reflect my workflow and technical competencies without revealing proprietary IP.
